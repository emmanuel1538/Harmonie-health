# 🏥 Harmonie Health: Operational Efficiency Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive *SQL data analysis* for Harmonie Medical Center, a leading healthcare institution. Facing operational pressures, Harmonie needed data-driven insights to improve patient care, reduce readmissions, and optimize staff responsiveness. This analysis transforms raw Electronic Health Record (EHR) data into actionable business intelligence, providing a framework for proactive intervention and strategic decision-making.



## 🎯 Business Challenge
Harmonie Health identified five critical areas for improvement:
1.  *Emergency Room Overload* with no real-time bottleneck insights.
2.  *Rising 30-day readmission rates* with unclear causes.
3.  *Delayed doctor-patient engagement* during peak hours.
4.  *Variable recovery outcomes* across departments.
5.  *Absence of real-time alerts* for at-risk patients.

## 🚀 Key Insights & Impact
- *🚨 Proactive Patient Safety:* Identified *111 patients* with abnormal vitals in a 48-hour period, enabling life-saving early interventions.
- *📈 Readmission Reduction:* Discovered *Cardiology* has the highest readmission rate (*26.77%*), providing a clear target for improved discharge protocols and follow-up care, potentially saving hundreds of thousands annually.
- *⏱ Operational Efficiency:* Pinpointed doctors with average response times *exceeding 10 minutes*, uncovering a key bottleneck affecting patient wait times and satisfaction.
- *📊 Data-Driven Framework:* delivered a scalable SQL-based reporting tool for ongoing analysis, empowering the operations team to make informed decisions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- *Database:* Microsoft SQL Server
- *Tools:* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- *Methodology:* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔍 How to Navigate This Project
1.  *For a Quick Summary:* Read the *Key Insights* above and the [Detailed Analysis](./Analysis/detailed_analysis.md).
2.  *For the Technical Deep Dive:* Explore the [SQL Scripts](./SQL_Scripts/) to see how each query was built.


## 💡 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL to solve real-world business problems. By moving from reactive reporting to proactive analytics, Harmonie Health can now prioritize patient safety, optimize resource allocation, and ultimately deliver higher quality, more efficient care. The solutions provided are not just queries but a foundational framework for a data-informed clinical operation.
